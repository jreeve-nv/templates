# Note to run a github actions workflow it must be in a directory called `.github/workflows` and have the extension `.yml` or `.yaml`

# can get pre-written actions via GitHub Marketplace (https://github.com/marketplace)
# can also define actions in a separate actions directory `.github/actions` using a `action.yml`
# or by referencing an action in a public repository, or a Docker container
